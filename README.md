<p>Hey there! Need plans for the weekend? Check out this simple website that helps you find events near you and nearing the date of the event. Filter by the popularity of the event.</p>


<h3>How it was done</h3>
<p>Utilized SeatGeek's API to get info for events</p>\
<p> API uses user location to find events near them </p>
<p>Utilized async function to call API and useEffect to call async function</p>
<p>Utilized useState to create variables that hold info for filters and and widgets at top of table</p>
<p>Utilized other functions to aid in better visualizing data on table in website</p>
<p>Utilized CSS for better visualization, especially table data</p>
